# Data-Analysis-Projects

These projects were completed by me for the Udacity Nanodegree program: Artificial Intelligence for Trading. The projects are finance focused, but use the tools and techniques relevant to data analysis for various industries.

The projects cover basic trading strategy testing, portfolio optimization, and alpha factor research. The later projects utilize natural language processing, deep neural networks and random forests. The final project deals with back testing trading algorithms to optimize parameters. 

All of these projects utilize Jupiter Notebooks and various Python libraries useful for data analysis such as Pandas and PyTorch . The primary library used for financial data, backtesting and factor research is Zipline.
